#### About

During my internship at Coddity I was assigned to improve on Coddity's blog. Which, in the end, lead to actually remaking it entirely from the ground up.

- Full redesign to stick closer to Coddity's design system, bring more modernity and joy of use.
- Switched from a Gatsby + GraphQL setup that felt too heavy and flawed for the job to SvelteKit.
- Less than 2 weeks from assignment to deployment.
- Fast iteration on design and article deployment workflow leveraging Coddity's staff feedback.
- Significant maintenability and ergonomics improvement from the previous version ðŸ˜Š
