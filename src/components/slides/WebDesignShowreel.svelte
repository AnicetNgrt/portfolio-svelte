        <p>My thought process when designing a website is often the same: First, I find a color palette that fits the mood I want to achieve. Second, I figure out a hierarchy of informations and links the user might want to have access to. Third, I use the hierarchy to build shapes, place them in the most ideal way, and I use the colors to more distinctively differenciate parts of the UI. Really, it's like painting or drawing. Mood -> composition -> construction.</p>

        <p>Designing is always a nice necessary and productive break from programming for me. Working on code for so many hours can get boring even for the most passionate programmers. Having such pleasing and relaxing side tasks such as design trully helps staying in the flow.</p>

        <p>I believe tools don't really matter, just find something that's expressive enough for your needs and master it. I'm using canva.com for everything and although it's fairly limiting, limitations are my jam. Limitations in art and design always help me find more originality even though it may seem paradoxal.</p>

        <p>My designs don't always get into real websites. Artists and designers have sketchbooks and many unfinished pieces, so do I. But this kind of work is always helpful. It's a very powerful training, plus one day you may get to build upon your sketches.</p>
